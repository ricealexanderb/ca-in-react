<h3>Learning about React by building cellular automata out of &lt;div> elements</h3>

I've been thinking about [KnitYak's cool textiles](https://knityak.com/collections/all?page=5) recently so when I needed a project idea the first thing that came to mind was a simple cellular automata.

Out of the [256 possible rule sets](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/supplement.html), the dropdown menu only includes the ones that are visually interesting when the first row has a single active cell. The way each successive row is calculated and the relationship between the rule number and that table of eight t-shaped arrangements at the top of the page is illustrated pretty well in [this section of the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Elementary_cellular_automata).

I'm working in an IDE, but I pasted the code from commit [4fa9db5](https://github.com/ricealexanderb/ca-in-react/commit/4fa9db5c1f5b0c7018d2ccb9f208afd0b3dbfe67) into [CodePen, where you can see it in action](https://codepen.io/ricealexanderb/pen/VwjBKzX).
